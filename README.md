<p><strong>Introduction to Spring Boot</strong></p>
<p>Spring Boot is a powerful framework that simplifies the development of Java applications by providing a convention-over-configuration approach. It eliminates the need for boilerplate code and allows developers to focus on building robust applications with minimal setup. With Spring Boot, you can quickly create standalone, production-ready Spring-based applications.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>Before getting started with Spring Boot, ensure you have the following prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Java Development Kit (JDK)11: Spring Boot is built on Java, so you'll need JDK installed on your system.</li>
    <li>Java Development Environment: You should set up a Java development environment, including a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.</li>
    <li>Build Tool: While not strictly required, it's recommended that you be familiar with build tools like Maven or Gradle, as they simplify project setup and dependency management.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>To install Spring Boot, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use Spring Initializr: Visit the <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a> website, which provides a web interface for generating Spring Boot projects. Specify project metadata such as Group, Artifact, and dependencies, then click "Generate" to download the project zip file.</li>
    <li>Extract the Project: After downloading the zip file, extract it to your desired location on your local machine.</li>
    <li>Import into IDE: Open your preferred IDE and import the Spring Boot project you just created. Most IDEs support importing Maven or Gradle projects directly.</li>
</ol>
